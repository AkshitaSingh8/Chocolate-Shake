First we have to put milk, chocolate syrup/chocolate, suger(optional) in the blender and blend it.
Next we have to add ice-cream and ice(optional) in it and blend.
Third step is to garnish, in it if you have chocolate syrup make design on the inner side of glass and if you don't have it just pour your shake in glass and put some ice-cream over the shake and make designs on the ice-cream with syrup or melted chocolate.
Put a straw and a spoon in glass and serve your cool shake in summers.
